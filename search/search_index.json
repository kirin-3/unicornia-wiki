Depending on how much a certain tool is used or a certain action is performed, players will gain experience that will eventually add bonuses such as double drops, rare drops, or ability enhancement. McMMO can drastically enhance everyday activities, such as mining, farming, or digging, where the special abilities can speed up the process and in some cases, give better item drops. McMMO is also widely used by players who like to partake in PvP, whether it be in the PvP world, or a private arena, McMMO is an opponent of its own and can affect the outcome of a fight in a skilled users hands. McMMO also has a competitive side to it, players race one another to see who can achieve a higher power level or skill level first. YOU CAN SEE THE LIST OF SKILLS AND YOUR PROGRESSION WITH THE /mcmmo COMMAND ON THE SERVER! For more up-to-date and in-depth information feel free to check out the official mcMMO wiki or this fan-made wiki . Power Level \u00b6 A player\u2019s power level can be determined by adding their total levels of all their skills (use /mcstats and /mcsb keep to test it out yourself). The power level itself has no true effect, aside from being a goal to strive for. Skills \u00b6 Skills are Broken into 3 Categories, Gathering, Combat, and Miscellaneous. Gathering \u00b6 Excavation \u00b6 Excavation in McMMO provides a passive ability to dig more blocks and find treasures buried beneath the earth. What you find is based on your skill level and the type of material you are excavating. \u200b The drops that are found from breaking blocks range from glow stone dust to discs and can turn a routine digging into a great profitable excavation. XP Gain: Experience is gained by using a shovel to break dirt, grass, sand, and clay. Active Abilities: Giga Drill Breaker Right-clicking with a Shovel in hand will activate Giga Drill Breaker. For a short period of time, it will allow you to instantly break any block that is most effective when broken with a shovel. The duration depends on the level. Passive Abilities: Treasure Hunter Each time you dig a block, there is a chance to obtain items you would not normally get from digging. These drops can make some extra money, or be used to craft some useful items. Items/Blocks/Levels/Drop Chance: Glowstone (Grass, Mycelium, and Dirt): level 25 [5%] Slimeball (Clay): level 150 [1%] Egg (Dirt): level 250 [1%] Gold Music Disc (13) (any): level 250 [0.05%] Apple (Grass and Mycelium): level 250 [0.1%] Green Music Disc (cat) (any): level 250 [0.05%] Red/Brown Mushroom (Dirt and Mycelium): level 500 [0.5%] Cake (any): level 750 [0.05%] Materials that give EXP: Grass, Dirt, Clay, Mycelium, Snow, and Soul Sand Fishing \u00b6 Fishing is a skill that enhances fishing in Minecraft. Fishing skills are all passive. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a challenge to make Fishing rewarding and interesting enough to spend time on, so what we\u2019ve done is gone the traditional RPG route. When you fish you will have a chance to find treasure. Among this treasure, you can find magic items. You will find better items as your skill progresses and the chance of finding magic items will also increase.\u201d \u2013 mcMMO Team. At skill level 150+ you will be able to hook items off of mobs, allowing an easier way to farm certain mob items. For example, if you desperately need eggs you can simply use the fishing rod to obtain the item by casting your line into a chicken. XP Gain: Experienced is gained by catching fish or treasures with a fishing rod, or by shaking items off of monsters and animals. Passive Abilities: Master Angler This passive ability improves the chance of catching a fish, this means that it will take less time before you get a bite! The ability activates when you\u2019re fishing in a boat or while you\u2019re fishing in an ocean biome. Unlocks at level 125 Ice Fishing This ability allows you to fish in icy biomes. Cast your fishing rod on an ice block and a water hole will appear. Unlocks at level 50 Treasure Hunter Player has a chance to find random items in addition to the fishes they reel in. Chance and quality of items increase as Fishing skill is leveled up! There is a 6.12% to 25% chance for the item pulled to be randomly enchanted. The strength/level of enchantment and odds of the said item being enchanted depends on the Fishing level and Treasure Hunter Tier. Magic Hunter Magic hunter is the probability of fishing an enchanted treasure with the probability of an enchanted item appearing, starting at 6.67% (rank \u2155) at level 1-199, and increasing by 6.67% per 200 Fishing levels. At level 800, the probability caps at a maximum of 33.3% (rank 5/5). Sometimes the message \u201cYou feel a touch of magic in this cast.\u201d will appear to indicate the skill activating. Shake From fishing level 150 onwards, the player will be able to shake items loose from mobs by hooking them with the fishing pole. Shake can be used repeatedly for a large number of items depending on the remaining health of the mob (Fishing Rod deals 1 damage to mobs). For instance, a Skeleton at full health can drop up to 37 arrows before they die. Herbalism \u00b6 Herbalism provides a series of benefits tied to food items in the Minecraft universe, including improved healing from some food, extra effects on seeds, and improved harvesting on every kind of plant, including mushrooms. XP Gain: Experienced is gained by harvesting crops, picking up flowers or plants. Active Abilities: Green Terra Right-clicking while holding a hoe activates Green Terra. Effects while activated: Chance to get 3x drops from harvesting plants. 100% chance to convert the following blocks as long as you have seeds in your inventory by left-clicking the blocks: Cobblestone into Mossy Cobblestone Stone Brick into Mossy Stone Brick Dirt into Grass Green Thumb An active ability that turns blocks into their plant-related counterparts. Green Thumb is triggered by right-clicking the blocks listed below while holding seeds, however, it has a low trigger chance unlike Green Terra, and the seeds will be consumed even if it fails. When successful, using Seeds on Cobblestone turns it into Mossy Cobblestone, Smooth Stone Brick turns it into Mossy Stone Brick, Dirt turns it into Grass Block Shroom Thumb An active ability that turns dirt & grass into mycelium. Green Thumb is triggered by right-clicking the blocks listed below while holding red or brown mushrooms, the mushrooms will be consumed even if the ability fails. Passive Abilities: Instant Wheat-Regrowth When harvesting fully-grown wheat, there is a chance for the player to instantly re-plant the wheat. The growth stage of the planted wheat is based on the Herbalism level. This skill does not require seeds to trigger, nor will it consume the seeds in inventory. Farmer\u2019s Diet Your past experience with growth hormones has taught you how to get the most out of your food. This passive skill increases the amount of hunger herbalism foods restores as your Herbalism level increases. Hylian Luck Hylian Luck gives players a passive chance to find treasures. Drops are rewarded when breaking: Grass Saplings Dead Bushes Flowers Flower Pots Grass/Saplings/Dead Bushes drop Melon Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, or Cocoa. Flowers drop potatoes, carrots, or apples. Flower pots break Emeralds, Diamonds, or Gold Nuggets. You have a 1% chance at level 100 for this drop to occur every time this block is broken, The chance goes up by 1% every 100 levels, so at level 1000% you\u2019d have a 10% chance for the drop to occur. Woodcutting \u00b6 Woodcutting is a skill that is centered around using an axe on wood, giant mushroom stalks, and leaves. XP Gain: Experience is gained by using an axe to break wood or giant mushroom stalks. Active Abilities: Tree Feller Tree feller is an active ability. It is activated by right-clicking with an axe in hand and breaking the bottom log of a tree. All the logs above the one destroyed will be destroyed as well. Tree feller uses two axe durability for every block destroyed. If the user\u2019s axe breaks while using Treefeller, the user will suffer damage and no additional blocks will be destroyed, besides the one the axe was broken on. The duration of Treefeller starts at 2 seconds, increasing one second every 50 levels without bound. Passive Abilities: Leaf Blower Leafblower is a passive ability unlocked at level 100. It allows the user to break leaves with an axe very quickly; When using leafblower, leaves are destroyed to have a 10% chance to drop saplings. Double Drop Double Drop is a passive ability that gives the chance for wood blocks to drop two, instead of one. The chance increases .1% at every level, for a maximum of 100% at level 1000. Mining \u00b6 Mining is a skill that provides a passive ability to increase drops from ores and it has two active abilities. One active ability allows you to break blocks faster and the other \u201cBlast Mining\u201d, allows you to use TNT as a mining device. XP Gain: XP is gained by breaking stones and ores using a pickaxe. Active Abilities: Super Breaker Super Breaker, while activated (by right-clicking with a pickaxe in hand), will add Efficiency V on your pickaxe, for a period of time depending on your mining level. If your pickaxe already had an Efficiency enchantment, 5 levels will get added to the pickaxe\u2019s previous enchantment. The duration of the skill starts at 2 seconds, increases by 1 second every 50 levels, up to 22 seconds at level 1000. Cool downtime is 240 seconds by default unaffected by level. This ability also allows you to triple the chance of getting double drops. Blast Mining Instead of using a pickaxe to break blocks, Blast Mining is done with TNT and Flint & Steel. This ability is activated by crouching and lighting TNT with a Flint & Steel. At higher levels, the player will receive Triple drops and no debris. As the number of drops gained from the explosion increases with your Mining level, so does the radius of the explosion. Damage taken by TNT lit with this ability is decreased, but not negated. Note that normally TNT drops 30% debris. Also, the blast radius of TNT increases at levels 250, 500, 750, and 1000. Passive Abilities: Double Drops Each time you level up in mining you get a 0.1% chance of getting 2 drops with every mine of an ore. For example, a level 500 miner will have a 50% chance to get a double drop from one ore! Double drops work on all materials that are gathered fastest with a pickaxe. (Stone, Ore, etc) Combat \u00b6 Unarmed \u00b6 Unarmed is a combat skill; it uses the player\u2019s empty hand as a weapon. It includes many perks, such as disarming, deflecting arrows, higher base unarmed attacks, and more. XP Gain: Experience is gained by using your bare hands in combat. (E.g. fighting with empty hands) Active Abilities: Beserk Berserk is an active ability that, for a short time, increases unarmed combat damage by 50%. It is activated by right-clicking a block with an empty hand, then punching a mob or block. Not only does it increase damage, but it can also very quickly break weak blocks, such as Dirt, Sand, and Clay; it can also turn Stone Bricks into Cracked Stone Bricks. While Berserk is activated, blocks can\u2019t be picked up. Berserk starts at 2 seconds, but can be increased 1 second every 50 levels infinitely; it is not limited by level 1000.

Alchemy \u00b6 Alchemy is about brewing potions. It provides a speed increase in the potion brew time, as well as the addition of new (previously) unobtainable potions. XP Gain: XP is gained by brewing potions. The amount of XP you receive depends on what stage of potion you are brewing. There are four stages of potions; base potion, regular potion, a potion with one amplifier, and a potion with two amplifiers. There is also a special potion stage for when you switch amplifiers, e.g. you add Redstone dust to a level II potion. Passive Abilities: Catalysis Catalysis speeds of the brewing process, with a max speed of 4x at level 1000. This ability is unlocked at level 100 by default. Concoctions Concoctions allow the brewing of more potions with custom ingredients. Which special ingredients are unlocked is determined by your Rank. There are 8 ranks to unlock. Important things to note about these custom recipes: The custom potions created only by unlockable recipes will always be colored red like an instant health potion, regardless of the effects. The custom potions created only by unlockable recipes cannot be empowered using glowstone or Redstone dust. Attempting to brew gunpowder or Dragon\u2019s Breath into the custom potions created only by unlockable recipes will result in an Uncraftable Splash or Lingering potion, respectively. This potion has no effect. However, using gunpowder or Dragon\u2019s Breath on an awkward potion and then adding the custom ingredient last will result in a Splash or Lingering potion of the proper effect, respectively. Ingredients that have been named in an anvil can NOT be used in Alchemy\u2019s custom recipes, and will not receive the Catalysis brewing speed boost. (i.e. a Slimeball named \u201cFred\u201d can NOT make a dull potion, and a Fermented Spider Eye named \u201cRIP George\u201d will brew at regular speed regardless of the brewer\u2019s Alchemy skill.)

For example, Fuel Efficiency reaches 4x at level 1000. Second Smelt This ability will grant a second piece of whatever you\u2019re smelting, whether it logs to charcoal, iron ore to iron, and even gold ore to gold. The chance of the player doing a second smelt increases 0.1% per Smelting level. At level 1000, you have a 100% chance of getting a second smelt. Vanilla XP Boost The Vanilla XP Boost ability is passive, like all Smelting abilities are, that grants more experience from a furnace when you smelt materials or ores such as iron ore, oak logs, and sand. The more levels you increase in the smelting skill, the more experience you will gain when you smelt something in a furnace. Like all abilities, Vanilla XP Boost caps at 1000 levels. Parties \u00b6 Party levels may be set to unlock at specific party levels. Parties let you create a group of people you can talk to without public chat listening to your conversation. Only if you are a party leader can you pick the games that your party plays.

When activated, it can negate up to 7 damage points or 3.5 hearts. Dodge Dodging is a passive skill that halves combat damage taken; this includes Creeper explosions, Skeleton arrows, etc. Its max chance is 20%, at level 800; each level its chance increased by .025%.","title":"Acrobatics"},{"location":"minecraft/mcmmo-guide/#alchemy","text":"Alchemy is about brewing potions. It provides a speed increase in the potion brew time, as well as the addition of new (previously) unobtainable potions. XP Gain: XP is gained by brewing potions. The amount of XP you receive depends on what stage of potion you are brewing. There are four stages of potions; base potion, regular potion, a potion with one amplifier, and a potion with two amplifiers. There is also a special potion stage for when you switch amplifiers, e.g. you add Redstone dust to a level II potion. Passive Abilities: Catalysis Catalysis speeds of the brewing process, with a max speed of 4x at level 1000. This ability is unlocked at level 100 by default. Concoctions Concoctions allow the brewing of more potions with custom ingredients. Which special ingredients are unlocked is determined by your Rank. There are 8 ranks to unlock. Important things to note about these custom recipes: The custom potions created only by unlockable recipes will always be colored red like an instant health potion, regardless of the effects. The custom potions created only by unlockable recipes cannot be empowered using glowstone or Redstone dust. Attempting to brew gunpowder or Dragon\u2019s Breath into the custom potions created only by unlockable recipes will result in an Uncraftable Splash or Lingering potion, respectively. This potion has no effect. However, using gunpowder or Dragon\u2019s Breath on an awkward potion and then adding the custom ingredient last will result in a Splash or Lingering potion of the proper effect, respectively. Ingredients that have been named in an anvil can NOT be used in Alchemy\u2019s custom recipes, and will not receive the Catalysis brewing speed boost. (i.e. a Slimeball named \u201cFred\u201d can NOT make a dull potion, and a Fermented Spider Eye named \u201cRIP George\u201d will brew at regular speed regardless of the brewer\u2019s Alchemy skill.)","title":"Alchemy"},{"location":"minecraft/mcmmo-guide/#smelting","text":"Smelting is a child skill of Mining and Repair. The effective Smelting level is the average of the parent skill levels. Smelting was the first child skill added to McMMO. Passive Abilities: Fuel Efficiency Fuel Efficiency is a passive ability of Smelting that makes the burn time of fuel in a furnace extend. Each level increases the efficiency multiplier by about 0.04. For example, Fuel Efficiency reaches 4x at level 1000. Second Smelt This ability will grant a second piece of whatever you\u2019re smelting, whether it logs to charcoal, iron ore to iron, and even gold ore to gold. The chance of the player doing a second smelt increases 0.1% per Smelting level. At level 1000, you have a 100% chance of getting a second smelt. Vanilla XP Boost The Vanilla XP Boost ability is passive, like all Smelting abilities are, that grants more experience from a furnace when you smelt materials or ores such as iron ore, oak logs, and sand. The more levels you increase in the smelting skill, the more experience you will gain when you smelt something in a furnace. Like all abilities, Vanilla XP Boost caps at 1000 levels.","title":"Smelting"},{"location":"minecraft/mcmmo-guide/#parties","text":"Party levels may be set to unlock at specific party levels.

Not all mobs are leveled, spawner mobs will not be leveled unless you have a special spawner that says otherwise. Also, there are some mobs that will never get leveled, which are: All Passive Mobs, including villagers Vex Baby mobs Ender Dragon Wither Phantom Bat How are the Levels calculated? \u00b6 Firstly, the levels are in a range you will not see only one specific level of mobs even if your mob scaling value is not changed. For the system to level mobs it first gets a number from your stats, you can see this value on your scoreboard(does not show on spawn world), if you do not have the scoreboard open you can do so with /tab scoreboard toggle command. The number next to the \"Mob Scaling:\" is the value the system uses to level mobs for you. What does the number mean though? \u00b6 As said previously there is a range of levels the mobs can spawn with based on your Mob Scaling value. The number on the left represents the \"Mob Scaling\" value range and the number on the right represents the value of levels that mobs can spawn with, if your Mob Scaling is in that range. Mob Scaling Range Mob Level Range 1-100 1-3 101-160 4-5 161-400 6-10 401-600 11-15 601-800 16-25 801-1000 26-34 1001-1300 35-45 1301-1500 46-54 1501-1800 55-60 1801-2100 61-66 2101-2400 67-70 2401-3000 70-76 3001-9999999 77-80 Example: If your \"Mob Scaling\" value is \"150\" the mobs around you will be level 4 or 5. If your \"Mob Scaling\" value is \"450\" the mobs around you will be between level 11 and 15. It is possible very rarely the mobs can spawn \u00b12 levels of what they are supposed to, so it is possible to spawn a mob slightly higher or lower than what the numbers above show. The level cap is 80. How is the Mob Scaling number calculated? \u00b6 The Mob Scaling number is: ( Your Total Wealth X 0.01) + ( Your play time in hours X 0.001) + ( Your balance/money X 0.0001). To explain further, the money part is simple it's just how much money you have times 0.0001, the playtime you are able to see in the stats page of the main menu. The wealth number comes from another plugin that calculates your value, it takes into account what you have in your claim area, in chests, containers, and what you have in your inventory. However, it does not calculate all the items. It calculates ores, valuable blocks, gear, and some custom items. To see a breakdown of your wealth and to see the number itself use the /st stats command. What is affected by the Levels? \u00b6 Now the actual nerdy part, firstly let me get the simple ones out of the way, the more levels the mob has it drops more money, more vanilla items, vanilla XP, and also custom drops(keys, XP bottles,mcmmo tokens). The levels also affect the base stats of the mobs. Every mob in the game has different stats firstly there are multipliers the system applies: Max health: 1.5 Movement speed: 0.3 Attack damage: 1.4 Ranged attack damage: 1.1 Creeper blast damage: 1.5 Follow range: 0.1 There is also attributes it applies to mobs, which normally doesn't happen in vanilla these are: Armor bonus: 0.2 Armor toughness: 0.04 Attack knockback: 0.2 Knockback resistance: 0.2 Zombie spawn reinforcements: 0.1 These are pretty straightforward in terms of what they do, the follow range is just detection/aggro range. Cool now we have some values but what do they mean really? Regarding Wardens Wardens are unique, they are leveled however the system doesn't change any base stats other than XP and item drop values, the higher level more drops but not harder wardens. Also, warden leveling is capped at 50 instead of 80. There is a very cool tool, plugin devs made for seeing what these numbers actually do. The Tool If you put the numbers given above into the respective boxes, you can select and mob you want and see how stats are changed based on levels. Under \"Multiplier Processing\" select \"Default\" and click on \"Display Multipliers\". Just in case the tool goes down or if you don't wanna bother with it here is the table showing what happens to Zombies at every level on our server: CurrentLevel MaxHealth AttackDamage MovementSpeed

you get more gear and stuff and play more. Not all mobs are leveled, spawner mobs will not be leveled unless you have a special spawner that says otherwise. Also, there are some mobs that will never get leveled, which are: All Passive Mobs, including villagers Vex Baby mobs Ender Dragon Wither Phantom Bat","title":"What is Mob Leveling?"},{"location":"minecraft/mobleveling/#how-are-the-levels-calculated","text":"Firstly, the levels are in a range you will not see only one specific level of mobs even if your mob scaling value is not changed. For the system to level mobs it first gets a number from your stats, you can see this value on your scoreboard(does not show on spawn world), if you do not have the scoreboard open you can do so with /tab scoreboard toggle command. The number next to the \"Mob Scaling:\" is the value the system uses to level mobs for you.","title":"How are the Levels calculated?"},{"location":"minecraft/mobleveling/#what-does-the-number-mean-though","text":"As said previously there is a range of levels the mobs can spawn with based on your Mob Scaling value. The number on the left represents the \"Mob Scaling\" value range and the number on the right represents the value of levels that mobs can spawn with, if your Mob Scaling is in that range. Mob Scaling Range Mob Level Range 1-100 1-3 101-160 4-5 161-400 6-10 401-600 11-15 601-800 16-25 801-1000 26-34 1001-1300 35-45 1301-1500 46-54 1501-1800 55-60 1801-2100 61-66 2101-2400 67-70 2401-3000 70-76 3001-9999999 77-80 Example: If your \"Mob Scaling\" value is \"150\" the mobs around you will be level 4 or 5. If your \"Mob Scaling\" value is \"450\" the mobs around you will be between level 11 and 15. It is possible very rarely the mobs can spawn \u00b12 levels of what they are supposed to, so it is possible to spawn a mob slightly higher or lower than what the numbers above show. The level cap is 80.","title":"What does the number mean though?"},{"location":"minecraft/mobleveling/#how-is-the-mob-scaling-number-calculated","text":"The Mob Scaling number is: ( Your Total Wealth X 0.01) + ( Your play time in hours X 0.001) + ( Your balance/money X 0.0001). To explain further, the money part is simple it's just how much money you have times 0.0001, the playtime you are able to see in the stats page of the main menu. The wealth number comes from another plugin that calculates your value, it takes into account what you have in your claim area, in chests, containers, and what you have in your inventory. However, it does not calculate all the items. It calculates ores, valuable blocks, gear, and some custom items. To see a breakdown of your wealth and to see the number itself use the /st stats command.","title":"How is the Mob Scaling number calculated?"},{"location":"minecraft/mobleveling/#what-is-affected-by-the-levels","text":"Now the actual nerdy part, firstly let me get the simple ones out of the way, the more levels the mob has it drops more money, more vanilla items, vanilla XP, and also custom drops(keys, XP bottles,mcmmo tokens). The levels also affect the base stats of the mobs. Every mob in the game has different stats firstly there are multipliers the system applies: Max health: 1.5 Movement speed: 0.3 Attack damage: 1.4 Ranged attack damage: 1.1 Creeper blast damage: 1.5 Follow range: 0.1 There is also attributes it applies to mobs, which normally doesn't happen in vanilla these are: Armor bonus: 0.2 Armor toughness: 0.04 Attack knockback: 0.2 Knockback resistance: 0.2 Zombie spawn reinforcements: 0.1 These are pretty straightforward in terms of what they do, the follow range is just detection/aggro range. Cool now we have some values but what do they mean really? Regarding Wardens Wardens are unique, they are leveled however the system doesn't change any base stats other than XP and item drop values, the higher level more drops but not harder wardens. Also, warden leveling is capped at 50 instead of 80. There is a very cool tool, plugin devs made for seeing what these numbers actually do. The Tool If you put the numbers given above into the respective boxes, you can select and mob you want and see how stats are changed based on levels. Under \"Multiplier Processing\" select \"Default\" and click on \"Display Multipliers\".

This is a guide for newcomers to the server, you can use the table of contents above to jump a specific content if you wish. This guide assumes you know the basics of Minecraft gameplay and how to join the server. First Join \u00b6 When you first join you will start with some items(tools, sword, food, armor\u2026) you will also receive a couple of keys. You can access the survival world by using the portal on your right or by typing /survival or /survival2 for 1.18 generated world. To go back to the spawn world you can use /spawn command. You also have a bed in your inventory, if you wish to pass the night try sleeping! This only works when the majority of the players on the server sleep at the same time. We use a GUI main menu on our server to access it simply press \u2018F\u2019 or type /menu . You can access almost everything from this menu, so when you join give this a look. To use the Keys you got you to need to go to the warp crates. You can do this via the F menu or by typing /warp crates ( /crates ) . Just right-click with the key in your hand to the right crate. If left-click a crate you can preview the items in it and your chances. Making Your Home \u00b6 When you are in the survival world you can use /rtp command to randomly spawn around the world. There is also a live server map where you can check a lot of things. Once you find a place to settle, you will have to claim it to secure it! The first chest you place in the server makes a 9\u00d79 claim by default, you can also expand it. To claim land you have to select two corners of your claim with a golden shovel. You can see our How to Claim Land guide if you wish. Everything in your claim is protected and PVP is disabled even infringe cases of grief we do full recovery so do not worry. This said you do not have unlimited claim blocks, you start with 280 blocks and you gain blocks hourly up to 14000. You can also buy claim blocks or earn from crates. For building the actual home you can get blocks from /shop , you can also get decoration blocks from /headdb . Homes \u00b6 When you first click a bed it will create your first home, you can go to this home by typing /home . To set a home you can use /sethome [name] the name is optional. To access this home later you just need to type /home [name] and you will teleport there! To see all of your homes type /homes . You can create up to 10 homes. VIP players can create up to 30. Death \u00b6 When you die in the server, your items automatically get put in a chest on your death location. When you respawn you should see a GUI with some options if you don\u2019t see this GUI try typing /acgui . You can either TP to your death location and claim your chest or fetch the chest to your current location. These both cost different amounts of money. Your chest stays up for 15 minutes after then it will get deleted. You will also get 70% of your XP back. Totems of Undying do work from your inventory meaning you do not have to put them on your off-hand. Useful Features \u00b6 There are player vaults you can access from the F menu, these are like virtual chests. Go to the F menu for more info. You can edit signs with shift-right click. You can sort your inventory or chests with buttons or auto sort them. Check out user settings in F menu for this.( /usersettings ) You can boost your Elytra flight with right-clicking while holing a feather. This costs 2XP per click. You can use this for launching as well. You can scroll trough paintings with mouse wheel. Making Money \u00b6 There are many ways you can make money. You can get daily/weekly keys. /rewards Regarding Keys Keys are good way of making money and getting some decent gear. There is a Key Exchange NPC in the /crates area, where you can trade your keys for better ones. To see the rewards and chaces in the crates just punch it(left-click). Mobs in the server drop money and can also drop XP and Keys. You can farm these for money. With keys, you can get money from crates or sell the keys to other players. You can sell most of the vanilla things on /shop . You can also get Keys from achievements. Jobs is a very good option to earn money and experience too for more info about it click here . Pets \u00b6 You can have your own pets on our server. They can be used to fight, carry things for you, give you beacon effects, and much more! Check out our Pets guide for more info.

You either need to buy them or tame them. To buy one type /petshop and this will open the pet shop in which you can buy almost every pet for pretty cheap. To tame a mob and make it a pet you will need to beat it with lead in your hand . Once they reach low enough HP they will become your pet. Be aware some mobs such as horses and donkeys require you to tame them with vanilla mechanics first. Players can have up to 3 pets in storage and 1 active pet at a time. To claim an additional pet you must first store your current pet with /petswitch store . You will not be able to call it or interact with your other pets while they are in storage. To interact with your MyPet you will need to make it your active MyPet by doing /petswitch and selecting the one you want to use. Pet GUI \u00b6 You can access a MyPet GUI with /pet command or by clicking on MyPet from the F menu. This GUI allows you to do almost everything without memorizing any commands! Skilltrees and Levels \u00b6 Pets can be assigned to a skill tree with /pcst , which allows them to level up and unlock new skills. There are 4 skill trees to choose from; Combat, Utility and Ride. Pets earn XP when they kill mobs, and also earn a small amount of XP any time you kill a mob. You can see individual skill trees here . Combat Specializes in doing damage and staying alive. It has HP regen and most damage out of all the skill trees. You also get a small inventory space and control skill. Ride A rideable pet that specializes in speed and jump height. Also able to fly depending on the mob type. Has decent inventory and pickup range as well. Ranged attacks. Utility Massive inventory, pickup range is pretty good, and can pick up XP after level 15. Speed beacon at level 25 +1 at level 50 and night vision. Equip Your Pet \u00b6 Some pets can hold items in their hands or wear armor. To equip a pet with something to hold or wear, simply right-click on your pet while shifting with the item in your hand. To remove the equipment right-click on your MyPet while shifting with shears in your hand. Naming Your Pet \u00b6 You can name your pet with /petname <name> . Please note that inappropriate names (anything that wouldn\u2019t be allowed to be said in chat) are not allowed. You can also use color codes in your pet names. Type /colors and /colorpicker in the server. Feed Your Pet \u00b6 You must feed your pet to keep its health up or it will die from hunger! If your pet is hungry it will also be weaker and will deal less damage when attacking. Each pet has a special food that it must be fed. You can see which food is right for your pet by doing /petinfo . How to Hide/Disable a MyPet \u00b6 There are two ways to disable a pet, and they work very differently. The first, /petsendaway , will hide your active MyPet until you un-hide it with /petcall . A pet that has been hidden is still considered your \u201cactive MyPet\u201d, it just isn\u2019t visible right now. It also only hides your pet during your current session, so your pet will reappear if you disconnect and reconnect to the server. The second way to disable a pet is to put it into storage with /petstore . Pets that are in storage are completely deactivated until you use /petswitch to choose the one you want to use. If all of your pets are in storage, the server will tell you that you do not have a MyPet. This is also how you can claim additional MyPets \u2013 by completely deactivating your current one first. Pet Behaviors \u00b6 You can change the way your pet attacks by changing its behavior. Different behaviors are unlocked as your pet levels up. The available behaviors are listed below. Friendly: Won\u2019t fight, even if it\u2019s attacked by anything\u200b Normal: Acts like a normal wolf Aggressive: Attacks everything within 15 blocks of the owner\u200b Farm: Attacks every hostile mob within 15 blocks of the owner Raid: Like normal, but the MyPet won\u2019t attack players and their pets Duel: Attacks other pets with active duel behavior within a 5 block radius\u200b Useful Commands \u00b6 Command Description /petcall Make your pet come to you if it was vanished\u200b. /pet Opens the MyPet GUI interface. /petsendaway Make your pet vanish temporarily. /petrelease Release your pet forever. /petinfo Check your pet\u2019s health and food as well as other stats. /pcst Choose a skilltree for your pet. /petskill Check your pet\u2019s skills and strengths\u200b. /petname Change the name of your pet (see Naming Your Pet above). /petinventory Open your pet\u2019s inventory to see what it has picked up. /petpickup Toggle whether your pet will pick up items or not. /petbehavior Change the behavior class of your pet (see Pet Behavior above). /petbeacon Turn your pet into a walking beacon to give you strength, speed, and other power-ups. /petswitch This allows you to switch between your MyPets. /petstore Store your current pet to claim another.

Introduction to SlimeFun \u00b6 Slimefun, abbreviated as \"SF\" is a plugin that adds technology to a server without the need for the players to install a mod themselves. It adds several new materials and ways to obtain them, improvements and add-ons to vanilla Minecraft mechanics as well as convenient items. You received a Slimefun Guidebook when you first joined, if you lost it you can get another by doing the command /slimefun guide or open it directly from the Main Menu, opened by your \"swap to offhand\" key, default F or by doing the command: /slimefun open_guide . In there you will find several categories of items, machines and gadgets. To research each of them, you will have to pay an EXP price, or alternatively, you can ask someone who has learned multiple recipes to give you a Tome of Knowledge Sharing which they have bound to themselves. You still need to research the Tome yourself to be able to use it though, as is the case for all SF items like backpacks. While all SF items can be obtained normally, you can also find many of the base materials in the Shop, opened from the Main Menu or by doing /shop and going to the Slimefun category. This can be very useful for tedious materials, so keep it in mind. Lastly, the Guidebook also contains a search feature, as well as a link to the Wiki , which while not always useful can clear some misunderstandings. General Roadmap \u00b6 SF requires an infrastructure to be set up, otherwise some items are simply unrealistic or outright impossible to obtain. This section will outline a generalistic roadmap that you can follow on your road to a better quality of life while dabbling in technology and supply chains, as well as automation of tasks. Getting Started: This stage is the beginning of your journey. You have nothing to begin with but your Slimefun Guide and a willingness to learn (hopefully) . In this stage, you will research essential items, machines, and structures, as well as build your basic infrastructure such as your first power grid and basic, manual machinery. Early Game Your early game will consist mostly of upgrades. You will upgrade most of your vanilla Minecraft items to SF ones where possible, as well as small upgrades to your infrastructure, but mostly expansion. Here you will also get further or outright finish researching all the items in the SF Guide. While not necessary it is recommended. Mid Game This is the most arduous part. Here you will have to make a very important decision, the decision of which energy generation system you will want to go with, as well as implementing that. This takes quite a lot of time and resources. In this phase, you will expand your infrastructure fully, including GPS and other systems. All vanilla items that can be upgraded will be upgraded. End Game This is the last phase, where you will max out everything. Every machine will be upgraded to its highest tier, your infrastructure will be fully expanded and upgraded, as well as starting on complex automation and advanced farms, full use of androids, and infinite resources. While this is the most demanding phase from the point of view of materials, you will already have automated much of the processes, so the amount of work required is not too high, it's mostly a time investment at this point. Getting Started \u00b6 Starting out in SF can be quite daunting, but not to worry, it's not too difficult. Let's start with the basic materials. These are dusts, of which there is a variety. There are 9 main ones that you will want to obtain and amass vast quantities of. These are Gold, Zinc, Magnesium, Silver, Tin, Lead, Copper, Aluminum, and Iron. While most of these are obtainable by mining, the most convenient method and the one by which you will be acquiring all of these will be gravel processing. This brings us to the machines you will need to research and build to start. All of these can be found in the Basic Machines category in the Slimefun Guide. You will need: an Enhanced Crafting Table a Grind Stone an Ore Crusher a Compressor a Smeltery (optionally an Automatic Ignition Chamber for it, but its effect can be obtained with just a dispenser filled with Flint & Steel hooked up to a fast redstone clock ) an Ore Washer an Automated Panning Machine How to see the recipes To see the recipe for a machine or an item open your slimefun guide book and click on the desired item. The middle part is the crafting recipe, the icon on the left will tell you where to recreate that recipe to craft it. In the shown example, place the items exactly as shown in the recipe in the Dispenser of an Enhanced Crafting Table, then right click the Crafting Table to craft the Enhanced Furnace. You can also click the components of the crafting recipe to learn more about them. It is highly recommended to get the materials for an Advanced Industrial Miner as well, this is an invaluable tool and you will be using it forever, for now fueling it with lava buckets. Just get yourself a bunch from the Nether and take them with you as you randomly teleport with /rtp , build your Miner on the spot and fuel it. You can carry the Miner's chest with a Dolly for convenience! Now let's go over the basic production chain you will have. You start with cobblestone or gravel, obtained usually from mining. If you start with cobblestone you will need to first pass it through the Grind Stone to turn it into gravel. Now you pass all the gravel through your Automated Panning Machine. I recommend setting up an auto clicker for this. From the Panning, you will get one of four possible items, clay which is considered waste, flint (8 of which can be used in the Compressor to recycle 1 cobblestone), an iron nugget (9 of which can be crafted into an iron ingot), and the most important one of them all, Sifted Ore. This Sifted Ore must be passed through the Ore Washer to obtain the base dusts discussed earlier. In terms of vanilla Minecraft resources, try to always obtain the ore instead of the item (i.e. Diamond Ore instead of Diamonds), as passing them through the Ore Crusher will double the drops from them. If you built the Advanced Industrial Miner, you will see that it always only gives you the ore, so you can just pass it through the Ore Crusher directly. Also, consider looking into an Enhanced Furnace, but I wouldn't go higher than Tier II at this point. Optionally, from the Energy and Electricity category, make an Energy Regulator and several crafts of Energy Connectors, you can never have enough of those. These will get you familiarized with the basics of SF and allow you to progress to the Early Game! Early Game \u00b6 This section outlines the upgrades and expansions that should be done next. Firstly, it is strongly recommended to set up an auto-clicker at this point if you haven't yet. This will be extremely useful. Now, having set up your basic production chain, it's time to expand it and move on from these manual machines, as well as getting yourself a bunch of convenience and comfort items. While you should try to research everything in the Guide, here's what's worth it and what isn't. Of these feel free to craft whatever you think would be useful or cool to have. If it isn't mentioned here, it's probably not worth the materials, in my opinion ! Play the game however you like, try all the items out if you want to! From the Useful Items category: the Portable Crafter and Dustbin, the Backpack (all tiers, the higher the better of course), the Cooler, and the Tape Measure From Basic Machines: the Output Chest, all of the Technical Components, all of Talismans Tier I (don't craft any of them by themselves, only to use as materials), all of Ender Talismans Tier II (they're a pain to craft, but I recommend getting the Angel, Wise, and Whirlwind ones, as once you craft them you never need to recraft them and they are quite useful) From Magical Gadgets, the Magical Zombie Pills, the Infused Magnet, the Tome of Knowledge Sharing, the Flask of Knowledge (only as an ingredient), the Ancient Pedestal and Altar, and the Infused Hopper (this one is a godsend, it can suck items through the floor allowing for really cool farms) From the Fluffy Machines, all items from the Fluffy Barrel subcategory (a note: don't go overboard, they cost significantly more to make the higher up you go, for most applications anything above the Small Barrel is likely realistically excessive), all items from the Misc. subcategory, all of Energy and Electricity, all of the GPS-Based Machines, all of Cargo Management. Again, I recommend trying to research everything and getting yourself some cool gadgets. Now on to your first power grid. Firstly, make sure you have one Energy Regulator, as well as plenty of Energy Connectors. The connectors say they have a range of 6 blocks, to be precise you can leave 5 blocks of space between them, as in <1 connector> <5 blocks> <1 connector>. They do not work diagonally, but they don't care what blocks, if any, are between connectors. For your first generator, I recommend making a Coal Generator Tier II as it uses normal furnace fuel, which is plentiful but be advised it uses quite a bit. Once you get this, it's time for upgrades! No more manual machinery (you will still need to move the items yourself unless you want to invest in Cargo Nodes already, which I do not recommend yet as they are very expensive, hoppers do not work). So from the Electricity category, make an Electric Gold Pan Tier II, an Electric Dust Washer Tier II, and an Electric Ore Grinder. I'm very specific with the tiers here, as your Coal Generator II produces 30J/s and these machines combined will be using 26J/s, these being the best tiers you can get for now. However, these will replace a lot of your old manual machinery. You can also invest in an Electric Furnace if you're interested, but you will only be able to use the Tier I one, as the others would go over your energy budget. You can power the higher Tier ones for short periods by making a Capacitor, your choice of tier, think of them as batteries. Of course, the other alternative is to just make sure you're not using the other machines while the Furnace is running. Now, let's take a look at your new production chain. First, cobblestone goes into the Electric Ore Grinder to be turned into gravel. The gravel goes into the Electric Gold Pan to be turned into the four possible products (you need to babysit this machine if you don't have Cargo Nodes). The Sifted Ore goes into the Electric Dust Washer to be turned to dusts! If you want Cargo Nodes, which I understand, please refer to the Mid Game section as they are detailed right at the beginning. This concludes the Early Game! You now know the basics of electricity, hopefully have most of the Guide researched, and are ready to amass the mountain of materials needed for the Mid Game. Well done, I'm very proud of you. \u2764\ufe0f Mid Game \u00b6 This section expands on the Early game. Here I will detail the full infrastructure you will need, as well as energy production. Firstly, let's talk about Cargo Nodes. If you haven't already gotten them, you will need to now. Four items are essential in a cargo system, the Cargo Manager, the Cargo Node (Connector) referred to as the Connector Node from here on, the Cargo Node (Input) referred to as the Input Node from here on, and the Cargo Node (Output) referred to as the Output Node from here on. You will need one Cargo Manager and several of the rest. The Input Node must be connected to the source from where the items should be taken. It has several settings, let's take them one by one. The Type setting allows you to choose between Whitelist and Blacklist. Whitelist means only the items placed in the 3x3 area on the left are taken, while Blacklist means all items EXCEPT the ones in the area are taken. This is useful for sorting purposes. Next up is the \"Smart Filling\" Mode, don't use it. That's all. Next up is the Round Robin Mode. This mode is very useful if you're trying to divide the output equally to multiple places. For example, if you have an animal farm that produces raw meat, instead of making a normal super-smelter you can take one input from the farm's chest and use this mode to distribute the meat equally in all your furnaces. The Include Lore option should generally be kept Off, but it has some niche uses for example if you want to sort for certain enchantments through several items (the items must have the same durability). Lastly, the Channel ID setting. This is a very important one. Essentially, a Cargo Manager will allow up to 16 channels. When you select a channel in the Input Node, you must select the same channel in the Output Node, and while it's okay to have multiple Output Nodes on the same channel, especially when using Round Robin Mode, it's usually undesirable to have multiple Input Nodes on the same channel, but entirely possible and with niche uses, such as needing to Whitelist / Blacklist more than 9 items at a time. Output Nodes only have Channel ID. To use Cargo Nodes, you must place the Input or Output Nodes directly on the side of the desired container/machine. It will not work on the top or bottom. Due to this, double chests offer up to 6 positions for Nodes whereas single chests and most machines only offer 4. This is it basically, but this brings us to storage. At this point, all of your dusts should be stored in individual Fluffy Barrels. These are containers that only store one type of item at a time, but truly vast quantities of it. I recommend the Small Fluffy Barrel, as it is the perfect compromise between the capacity and difficulty of crafting. I recommend buying the 8 Reinforced Alloy Ingots the Plate requires from the Shop, as they're very tedious to make. If you need more space than this for something, that's impressive. If you have any farms that you want to never have to worry about storage capacity again, upgrade those to use Fluffy Barrels as well. Now to the hard part. The energy production question. There are 3 big ways of producing electricity in SF, each with its ups and downs, that I will outline next. Choose one, and build it. Fossil Fuels I do not recommend this type. Its advantages are that it is by far the easiest and cheapest to set up, as well as running on fairly abundant materials, those being mostly Coal, optionally Lava, and/or Oil / Fuel. Its disadvantage is that it's a material-devouring monster. You will probably need to set up a sizeable Wither Skeleton farm, from Spawners or a vanilla one, to be able to feed it without having to constantly go out for Industrial Miner runs. This type is achieved simply by having a big stack of Coal Generator Tier II, optionally in combination with Lava and/or Combustion Generators. Nuclear I would recommend this one. Its advantages are that it produces vast amounts of power as well as needing comparatively little maintenance. Its main disadvantage is that it is somewhat complicated to set up and needs an operational GPS to be able to fuel it. Also will require some modification to the production chain. This type starts as a Nuclear Reactor, see wiki for setup , and then will be upgraded to a Nether Star Reactor in the End Game. Solar I would recommend this one and is the one I currently use. Its main advantages are truly zero maintenance required, you make them and they run forever, which is great for someone lazy like me, as well as portability as I can just pick one up and plop it down somewhere else for some quick Oil mining or so. Its biggest disadvantage is that it is the most expensive of them all, it requires immense amounts of materials and you must make the last tier, Energized Solar Panels, for them to be useable all the time, since none of the previous Tiers work during the night. This type is achieved by crafting a cluster of Energized Solar Panels and placing them somewhere, I have 9 of them and am not using them anywhere near full capacity even during the night. After choosing one and building it, you'll be done with energy generation. Do keep in mind you don't need to deploy it fully, for example just a few Coal Generators, one Nuclear Reactor, or one or two Energized Solar Panels are more than enough for now, even if later on in the End Game you will need more. Next up, let's talk GPS. This entire system is optional to some degree, if you're using Nuclear Power it's a must, but is generally nice to have regardless. The GPS infrastructure has only one essential part, but on its own it is useless, this is the GPS Transmitter. To start with craft any Tier that you're comfortable with in terms of energy usage, you can always upgrade it later. To use it most effectively, build up to the height limit of the world with a 1 block tower, place one Energy Connector, 5 blocks, one Energy Connector, etc. to get power up to it, then at the height limit place the Transmitter. Now, to use it with Nuclear Power or to get Fuel (the item) for your Fossil Fuels power, you will need a Portable Geo-Scanner as well as a Geo Miner and/or Oil Pump. Keep in mind that Fuel (the item) can and should also be used for the Advanced Industrial Miner. The way to use these is to use the Scanner to scan a chunk (press F3 + G to show or hide chunk borders), then use the Miner for materials or the Oil Pump for Oil. I recommend taking a portable power source, solar panel, battery, etc., and doing /rtp to just find an untapped chunk. Now for the subjectively coolest part of GPS, teleportation, you will need the GPS Control Panel, one GPS Marker Tool, a craft of GPS Teleporter Pylons, one GPS Teleporter Matrix, and one GPS Activation Device, your choice which one. Now you may ask, \"Isn't this the same as setting a home somewhere?\" and yes it is, but now you can set waypoints inside people's claims without permission hehe. Also, there is a limit on the amount of homes you can have, although the limit is pretty high. Next up let's talk about upgrades. Now that your power grid can support it, you can upgrade the dust production chain if you want to, as well as optionally look into Electric Furnaces if you want to, although a Carbonado Edged Furnace is better than the Tier III Electric Furnace. Sadly, however, the smeltery is a special case. It is by far the fastest option for smelting dusts into ingots and making alloys, as well as being only one machine as opposed to the two it would take to electrify it, namely the Electric Ingot Factory and the Electric Smeltery, both of which are significantly slower even at the highest tier compared to the manual Smeltery machine, which has no processing time at all and can be extremely speedy with the use of an auto clicker. However, these two will allow automatization, whereas otherwise that would not be possible. Hopefully, you will have upgraded your dusts production chain with Cargo Nodes by now, but if you haven't here's an example setup (mine), the channel will be abbreviated to ch for ease: Cobblestone Generator (the machine) -> (ch1 whitelist cobble) -> Electric Ore Grinder -> (ch2 whitelist Gravel) -> Electric Gold Pan -> (ch3 whitelist Sifted Ore) (ch4 whitelist Iron Nugget) (ch5 whitelist Flint) (ch6 whitelist Clay) -> (ch3: Electric Dust Washer -> ch7 blacklist none to an item sorter) (ch4: autocraft to Iron Ingot -> ch8 whitelist Iron Ingot to Electric Ingot Pulverizer) (ch5: Electric Press to Cobble -> ch9 back to the Electric Ore Grinder) (ch6: straight into a Trash Can, the machine). Hopefully, this can give you a good idea of how a (my) production chain would look like for dusts, of course, this assumes you don't use Nuclear Power, in which case you can make some adjustments to get more Uranium. Lastly, let's talk about some vanilla Minecraft upgrades. While the armor and weapons are not worth it, there are several items that make life easier, for example: the Dolly, the Concrete Factory, and the Animal / Tree Growth Accelerator (keep in mind these come with their own production chains). There are also fun items like the Helicopter Helmet, Jetpack / Jet Boots, etc. This concludes the Mid Game! You now have a proper plan and implementation for energy production, a fully developed and mapped-out infrastructure, and many convenient and comfort items! I am extremely proud of you for sticking it out through this part, this being the most intense part of your SF journey, so well done, and keep at it. \u2764\ufe0f Late Game \u00b6 Here I will detail the final goals of SF, from complete automatization to upgrading everything. Firstly, make sure your power grid can produce enough electricity for both now and future expansions/projects. Next up, bring all your machinery up to its maximum tier, except maybe GPS if you don't use Teleportation. The time saved adds up rather quickly. And now, finally, let's talk about androids and complete automatization. This involves the use of autocrafters quite often as it is an amazing feature. Androids come in many different types, but all of them require a Fuel Interface, and most require an Item Interface. You can fuel them in a variety of ways that you can see in the Slimefun Guide. Your choice of fuel is quite important. While all of them can be pulled off, they vary in convenience and ease. Coal is the only non self-sustaining one unless you get yourself a Wither Skeleton farm which produces heavily. Logs are inferior to planks, one log powers an Android for 2 seconds, while it can be crafted into 4 planks meaning 4 seconds of run time. So if you accept the cost, a Woodcutter Android will be self-sufficient as long as it's always cutting. The best fuel in my opinion is the Dried Kelp Block. They are easily passively farmed, and a simple production chain can infinitely stockpile fuel whenever you need it. A sample: Kelp farm > temporary container as buffer > furnace (your choice of which kind, and how many you need depends on the size of your kelp farm, which depends on the number of androids you intend to run off it) > autocrafter to dried kelp blocks > Fluffy Barrel > Android Interface (Fuel). You can use Androids in many ways for automation, one thing worthy of note is that Butcher Anroids are special, in that they behave as if the player killed the mob in question. This is important for certain farms such as Basic Circuit farms, as well as Wither Skull farms. This brings us to the next farm you can make now, the Wither farm. You can make an enclosure for the Wither and let it suffocate to death with a simple setup, netting you infinite Nether Stars for any purpose, from simply selling them in the shop to powering your Nether Star Reactor. I will detail the setup next. Wither Assembler settings: Offset +1.0 Blocks. And now for the production chain for infinite Soul Sand: Cobblestone Generator (the machine) > Pulverizer (you get sand) > Electric Composter II > Wither Assembler. And now you can get infinite Sould Sand! This concludes the End Game! Congratulations, you did it! For now. Keep expanding, get bigger and better farms, more of them, make them more efficient, keep at it! You now have both the access to and the know-how on basically everything in SlimeFun! So keep at it, and well done \u2764\ufe0f Tips and tricks \u00b6 There are definitely some things that I wish I knew and learned embarrassingly late. These are in no particular order. Always make more than you need at the moment. Almost everything has more than one use, so you may very well need more. Specifically Magnets. Just make a lot of them. Use the /sfcalc calc {item} a lot. It will calculate the number of base materials you need for the given item. However do know that it's not perfect, sometimes it will make some small mistakes, especially with what it considers a base material. Some items are far more worth it to buy than make yourself.

It adds several new materials and ways to obtain them, improvements and add-ons to vanilla Minecraft mechanics as well as convenient items. You received a Slimefun Guidebook when you first joined, if you lost it you can get another by doing the command /slimefun guide or open it directly from the Main Menu, opened by your \"swap to offhand\" key, default F or by doing the command: /slimefun open_guide . In there you will find several categories of items, machines and gadgets. To research each of them, you will have to pay an EXP price, or alternatively, you can ask someone who has learned multiple recipes to give you a Tome of Knowledge Sharing which they have bound to themselves. You still need to research the Tome yourself to be able to use it though, as is the case for all SF items like backpacks. While all SF items can be obtained normally, you can also find many of the base materials in the Shop, opened from the Main Menu or by doing /shop and going to the Slimefun category. This can be very useful for tedious materials, so keep it in mind. Lastly, the Guidebook also contains a search feature, as well as a link to the Wiki , which while not always useful can clear some misunderstandings.","title":"Introduction to SlimeFun"},{"location":"minecraft/slimefunguide/#general-roadmap","text":"SF requires an infrastructure to be set up, otherwise some items are simply unrealistic or outright impossible to obtain. This section will outline a generalistic roadmap that you can follow on your road to a better quality of life while dabbling in technology and supply chains, as well as automation of tasks. Getting Started: This stage is the beginning of your journey. You have nothing to begin with but your Slimefun Guide and a willingness to learn (hopefully) . In this stage, you will research essential items, machines, and structures, as well as build your basic infrastructure such as your first power grid and basic, manual machinery. Early Game Your early game will consist mostly of upgrades. You will upgrade most of your vanilla Minecraft items to SF ones where possible, as well as small upgrades to your infrastructure, but mostly expansion. Here you will also get further or outright finish researching all the items in the SF Guide. While not necessary it is recommended. Mid Game This is the most arduous part. Here you will have to make a very important decision, the decision of which energy generation system you will want to go with, as well as implementing that. This takes quite a lot of time and resources. In this phase, you will expand your infrastructure fully, including GPS and other systems. All vanilla items that can be upgraded will be upgraded. End Game This is the last phase, where you will max out everything. Every machine will be upgraded to its highest tier, your infrastructure will be fully expanded and upgraded, as well as starting on complex automation and advanced farms, full use of androids, and infinite resources. While this is the most demanding phase from the point of view of materials, you will already have automated much of the processes, so the amount of work required is not too high, it's mostly a time investment at this point.","title":"General Roadmap"},{"location":"minecraft/slimefunguide/#getting-started","text":"Starting out in SF can be quite daunting, but not to worry, it's not too difficult. Let's start with the basic materials. These are dusts, of which there is a variety. There are 9 main ones that you will want to obtain and amass vast quantities of. These are Gold, Zinc, Magnesium, Silver, Tin, Lead, Copper, Aluminum, and Iron. While most of these are obtainable by mining, the most convenient method and the one by which you will be acquiring all of these will be gravel processing. This brings us to the machines you will need to research and build to start. All of these can be found in the Basic Machines category in the Slimefun Guide. You will need: an Enhanced Crafting Table a Grind Stone an Ore Crusher a Compressor a Smeltery (optionally an Automatic Ignition Chamber for it, but its effect can be obtained with just a dispenser filled with Flint & Steel hooked up to a fast redstone clock ) an Ore Washer an Automated Panning Machine How to see the recipes To see the recipe for a machine or an item open your slimefun guide book and click on the desired item. The middle part is the crafting recipe, the icon on the left will tell you where to recreate that recipe to craft it. In the shown example, place the items exactly as shown in the recipe in the Dispenser of an Enhanced Crafting Table, then right click the Crafting Table to craft the Enhanced Furnace. You can also click the components of the crafting recipe to learn more about them. It is highly recommended to get the materials for an Advanced Industrial Miner as well, this is an invaluable tool and you will be using it forever, for now fueling it with lava buckets. Just get yourself a bunch from the Nether and take them with you as you randomly teleport with /rtp , build your Miner on the spot and fuel it. You can carry the Miner's chest with a Dolly for convenience! Now let's go over the basic production chain you will have. You start with cobblestone or gravel, obtained usually from mining. If you start with cobblestone you will need to first pass it through the Grind Stone to turn it into gravel. Now you pass all the gravel through your Automated Panning Machine. I recommend setting up an auto clicker for this. From the Panning, you will get one of four possible items, clay which is considered waste, flint (8 of which can be used in the Compressor to recycle 1 cobblestone), an iron nugget (9 of which can be crafted into an iron ingot), and the most important one of them all, Sifted Ore. This Sifted Ore must be passed through the Ore Washer to obtain the base dusts discussed earlier. In terms of vanilla Minecraft resources, try to always obtain the ore instead of the item (i.e. Diamond Ore instead of Diamonds), as passing them through the Ore Crusher will double the drops from them. If you built the Advanced Industrial Miner, you will see that it always only gives you the ore, so you can just pass it through the Ore Crusher directly. Also, consider looking into an Enhanced Furnace, but I wouldn't go higher than Tier II at this point. Optionally, from the Energy and Electricity category, make an Energy Regulator and several crafts of Energy Connectors, you can never have enough of those. These will get you familiarized with the basics of SF and allow you to progress to the Early Game!","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"minecraft/slimefunguide/#early-game","text":"This section outlines the upgrades and expansions that should be done next. Firstly, it is strongly recommended to set up an auto-clicker at this point if you haven't yet. This will be extremely useful. Now, having set up your basic production chain, it's time to expand it and move on from these manual machines, as well as getting yourself a bunch of convenience and comfort items. While you should try to research everything in the Guide, here's what's worth it and what isn't. Of these feel free to craft whatever you think would be useful or cool to have. If it isn't mentioned here, it's probably not worth the materials, in my opinion ! Play the game however you like, try all the items out if you want to! From the Useful Items category: the Portable Crafter and Dustbin, the Backpack (all tiers, the higher the better of course), the Cooler, and the Tape Measure From Basic Machines: the Output Chest, all of the Technical Components, all of Talismans Tier I (don't craft any of them by themselves, only to use as materials), all of Ender Talismans Tier II (they're a pain to craft, but I recommend getting the Angel, Wise, and Whirlwind ones, as once you craft them you never need to recraft them and they are quite useful) From Magical Gadgets, the Magical Zombie Pills, the Infused Magnet, the Tome of Knowledge Sharing, the Flask of Knowledge (only as an ingredient), the Ancient Pedestal and Altar, and the Infused Hopper (this one is a godsend, it can suck items through the floor allowing for really cool farms) From the Fluffy Machines, all items from the Fluffy Barrel subcategory (a note: don't go overboard, they cost significantly more to make the higher up you go, for most applications anything above the Small Barrel is likely realistically excessive), all items from the Misc. subcategory, all of Energy and Electricity, all of the GPS-Based Machines, all of Cargo Management. Again, I recommend trying to research everything and getting yourself some cool gadgets. Now on to your first power grid. Firstly, make sure you have one Energy Regulator, as well as plenty of Energy Connectors. The connectors say they have a range of 6 blocks, to be precise you can leave 5 blocks of space between them, as in <1 connector> <5 blocks> <1 connector>. They do not work diagonally, but they don't care what blocks, if any, are between connectors. For your first generator, I recommend making a Coal Generator Tier II as it uses normal furnace fuel, which is plentiful but be advised it uses quite a bit. Once you get this, it's time for upgrades! No more manual machinery (you will still need to move the items yourself unless you want to invest in Cargo Nodes already, which I do not recommend yet as they are very expensive, hoppers do not work). So from the Electricity category, make an Electric Gold Pan Tier II, an Electric Dust Washer Tier II, and an Electric Ore Grinder. I'm very specific with the tiers here, as your Coal Generator II produces 30J/s and these machines combined will be using 26J/s, these being the best tiers you can get for now. However, these will replace a lot of your old manual machinery. You can also invest in an Electric Furnace if you're interested, but you will only be able to use the Tier I one, as the others would go over your energy budget. You can power the higher Tier ones for short periods by making a Capacitor, your choice of tier, think of them as batteries. Of course, the other alternative is to just make sure you're not using the other machines while the Furnace is running. Now, let's take a look at your new production chain. First, cobblestone goes into the Electric Ore Grinder to be turned into gravel. The gravel goes into the Electric Gold Pan to be turned into the four possible products (you need to babysit this machine if you don't have Cargo Nodes). The Sifted Ore goes into the Electric Dust Washer to be turned to dusts! If you want Cargo Nodes, which I understand, please refer to the Mid Game section as they are detailed right at the beginning. This concludes the Early Game! You now know the basics of electricity, hopefully have most of the Guide researched, and are ready to amass the mountain of materials needed for the Mid Game. Well done, I'm very proud of you. \u2764\ufe0f","title":"Early Game"},{"location":"minecraft/slimefunguide/#mid-game","text":"This section expands on the Early game. Here I will detail the full infrastructure you will need, as well as energy production. Firstly, let's talk about Cargo Nodes. If you haven't already gotten them, you will need to now. Four items are essential in a cargo system, the Cargo Manager, the Cargo Node (Connector) referred to as the Connector Node from here on, the Cargo Node (Input) referred to as the Input Node from here on, and the Cargo Node (Output) referred to as the Output Node from here on. You will need one Cargo Manager and several of the rest. The Input Node must be connected to the source from where the items should be taken. It has several settings, let's take them one by one. The Type setting allows you to choose between Whitelist and Blacklist. Whitelist means only the items placed in the 3x3 area on the left are taken, while Blacklist means all items EXCEPT the ones in the area are taken. This is useful for sorting purposes. Next up is the \"Smart Filling\" Mode, don't use it. That's all. Next up is the Round Robin Mode. This mode is very useful if you're trying to divide the output equally to multiple places. For example, if you have an animal farm that produces raw meat, instead of making a normal super-smelter you can take one input from the farm's chest and use this mode to distribute the meat equally in all your furnaces. The Include Lore option should generally be kept Off, but it has some niche uses for example if you want to sort for certain enchantments through several items (the items must have the same durability). Lastly, the Channel ID setting. This is a very important one. Essentially, a Cargo Manager will allow up to 16 channels. When you select a channel in the Input Node, you must select the same channel in the Output Node, and while it's okay to have multiple Output Nodes on the same channel, especially when using Round Robin Mode, it's usually undesirable to have multiple Input Nodes on the same channel, but entirely possible and with niche uses, such as needing to Whitelist / Blacklist more than 9 items at a time. Output Nodes only have Channel ID. To use Cargo Nodes, you must place the Input or Output Nodes directly on the side of the desired container/machine. It will not work on the top or bottom. Due to this, double chests offer up to 6 positions for Nodes whereas single chests and most machines only offer 4. This is it basically, but this brings us to storage. At this point, all of your dusts should be stored in individual Fluffy Barrels. These are containers that only store one type of item at a time, but truly vast quantities of it. I recommend the Small Fluffy Barrel, as it is the perfect compromise between the capacity and difficulty of crafting. I recommend buying the 8 Reinforced Alloy Ingots the Plate requires from the Shop, as they're very tedious to make. If you need more space than this for something, that's impressive. If you have any farms that you want to never have to worry about storage capacity again, upgrade those to use Fluffy Barrels as well. Now to the hard part. The energy production question. There are 3 big ways of producing electricity in SF, each with its ups and downs, that I will outline next. Choose one, and build it. Fossil Fuels I do not recommend this type. Its advantages are that it is by far the easiest and cheapest to set up, as well as running on fairly abundant materials, those being mostly Coal, optionally Lava, and/or Oil / Fuel. Its disadvantage is that it's a material-devouring monster. You will probably need to set up a sizeable Wither Skeleton farm, from Spawners or a vanilla one, to be able to feed it without having to constantly go out for Industrial Miner runs. This type is achieved simply by having a big stack of Coal Generator Tier II, optionally in combination with Lava and/or Combustion Generators. Nuclear I would recommend this one. Its advantages are that it produces vast amounts of power as well as needing comparatively little maintenance. Its main disadvantage is that it is somewhat complicated to set up and needs an operational GPS to be able to fuel it. Also will require some modification to the production chain. This type starts as a Nuclear Reactor, see wiki for setup , and then will be upgraded to a Nether Star Reactor in the End Game. Solar I would recommend this one and is the one I currently use. Its main advantages are truly zero maintenance required, you make them and they run forever, which is great for someone lazy like me, as well as portability as I can just pick one up and plop it down somewhere else for some quick Oil mining or so. Its biggest disadvantage is that it is the most expensive of them all, it requires immense amounts of materials and you must make the last tier, Energized Solar Panels, for them to be useable all the time, since none of the previous Tiers work during the night. This type is achieved by crafting a cluster of Energized Solar Panels and placing them somewhere, I have 9 of them and am not using them anywhere near full capacity even during the night. After choosing one and building it, you'll be done with energy generation. Do keep in mind you don't need to deploy it fully, for example just a few Coal Generators, one Nuclear Reactor, or one or two Energized Solar Panels are more than enough for now, even if later on in the End Game you will need more. Next up, let's talk GPS. This entire system is optional to some degree, if you're using Nuclear Power it's a must, but is generally nice to have regardless. The GPS infrastructure has only one essential part, but on its own it is useless, this is the GPS Transmitter. To start with craft any Tier that you're comfortable with in terms of energy usage, you can always upgrade it later. To use it most effectively, build up to the height limit of the world with a 1 block tower, place one Energy Connector, 5 blocks, one Energy Connector, etc. to get power up to it, then at the height limit place the Transmitter. Now, to use it with Nuclear Power or to get Fuel (the item) for your Fossil Fuels power, you will need a Portable Geo-Scanner as well as a Geo Miner and/or Oil Pump. Keep in mind that Fuel (the item) can and should also be used for the Advanced Industrial Miner. The way to use these is to use the Scanner to scan a chunk (press F3 + G to show or hide chunk borders), then use the Miner for materials or the Oil Pump for Oil. I recommend taking a portable power source, solar panel, battery, etc., and doing /rtp to just find an untapped chunk. Now for the subjectively coolest part of GPS, teleportation, you will need the GPS Control Panel, one GPS Marker Tool, a craft of GPS Teleporter Pylons, one GPS Teleporter Matrix, and one GPS Activation Device, your choice which one. Now you may ask, \"Isn't this the same as setting a home somewhere?\" and yes it is, but now you can set waypoints inside people's claims without permission hehe. Also, there is a limit on the amount of homes you can have, although the limit is pretty high. Next up let's talk about upgrades. Now that your power grid can support it, you can upgrade the dust production chain if you want to, as well as optionally look into Electric Furnaces if you want to, although a Carbonado Edged Furnace is better than the Tier III Electric Furnace. Sadly, however, the smeltery is a special case. It is by far the fastest option for smelting dusts into ingots and making alloys, as well as being only one machine as opposed to the two it would take to electrify it, namely the Electric Ingot Factory and the Electric Smeltery, both of which are significantly slower even at the highest tier compared to the manual Smeltery machine, which has no processing time at all and can be extremely speedy with the use of an auto clicker. However, these two will allow automatization, whereas otherwise that would not be possible. Hopefully, you will have upgraded your dusts production chain with Cargo Nodes by now, but if you haven't here's an example setup (mine), the channel will be abbreviated to ch for ease: Cobblestone Generator (the machine) -> (ch1 whitelist cobble) -> Electric Ore Grinder -> (ch2 whitelist Gravel) -> Electric Gold Pan -> (ch3 whitelist Sifted Ore) (ch4 whitelist Iron Nugget) (ch5 whitelist Flint) (ch6 whitelist Clay) -> (ch3: Electric Dust Washer -> ch7 blacklist none to an item sorter) (ch4: autocraft to Iron Ingot -> ch8 whitelist Iron Ingot to Electric Ingot Pulverizer) (ch5: Electric Press to Cobble -> ch9 back to the Electric Ore Grinder) (ch6: straight into a Trash Can, the machine). Hopefully, this can give you a good idea of how a (my) production chain would look like for dusts, of course, this assumes you don't use Nuclear Power, in which case you can make some adjustments to get more Uranium. Lastly, let's talk about some vanilla Minecraft upgrades. While the armor and weapons are not worth it, there are several items that make life easier, for example: the Dolly, the Concrete Factory, and the Animal / Tree Growth Accelerator (keep in mind these come with their own production chains). There are also fun items like the Helicopter Helmet, Jetpack / Jet Boots, etc. This concludes the Mid Game! You now have a proper plan and implementation for energy production, a fully developed and mapped-out infrastructure, and many convenient and comfort items! I am extremely proud of you for sticking it out through this part, this being the most intense part of your SF journey, so well done, and keep at it. \u2764\ufe0f","title":"Mid Game"},{"location":"minecraft/slimefunguide/#late-game","text":"Here I will detail the final goals of SF, from complete automatization to upgrading everything. Firstly, make sure your power grid can produce enough electricity for both now and future expansions/projects. Next up, bring all your machinery up to its maximum tier, except maybe GPS if you don't use Teleportation. The time saved adds up rather quickly. And now, finally, let's talk about androids and complete automatization. This involves the use of autocrafters quite often as it is an amazing feature. Androids come in many different types, but all of them require a Fuel Interface, and most require an Item Interface. You can fuel them in a variety of ways that you can see in the Slimefun Guide. Your choice of fuel is quite important. While all of them can be pulled off, they vary in convenience and ease. Coal is the only non self-sustaining one unless you get yourself a Wither Skeleton farm which produces heavily. Logs are inferior to planks, one log powers an Android for 2 seconds, while it can be crafted into 4 planks meaning 4 seconds of run time. So if you accept the cost, a Woodcutter Android will be self-sufficient as long as it's always cutting. The best fuel in my opinion is the Dried Kelp Block. They are easily passively farmed, and a simple production chain can infinitely stockpile fuel whenever you need it. A sample: Kelp farm > temporary container as buffer > furnace (your choice of which kind, and how many you need depends on the size of your kelp farm, which depends on the number of androids you intend to run off it) > autocrafter to dried kelp blocks > Fluffy Barrel > Android Interface (Fuel). You can use Androids in many ways for automation, one thing worthy of note is that Butcher Anroids are special, in that they behave as if the player killed the mob in question. This is important for certain farms such as Basic Circuit farms, as well as Wither Skull farms. This brings us to the next farm you can make now, the Wither farm. You can make an enclosure for the Wither and let it suffocate to death with a simple setup, netting you infinite Nether Stars for any purpose, from simply selling them in the shop to powering your Nether Star Reactor. I will detail the setup next. Wither Assembler settings: Offset +1.0 Blocks. And now for the production chain for infinite Soul Sand: Cobblestone Generator (the machine) > Pulverizer (you get sand) > Electric Composter II > Wither Assembler. And now you can get infinite Sould Sand! This concludes the End Game! Congratulations, you did it! For now. Keep expanding, get bigger and better farms, more of them, make them more efficient, keep at it! You now have both the access to and the know-how on basically everything in SlimeFun!

Use the /sfcalc calc {item} a lot. It will calculate the number of base materials you need for the given item. However do know that it's not perfect, sometimes it will make some small mistakes, especially with what it considers a base material. Some items are far more worth it to buy than make yourself.
