Hello and welcome to the new player guide!

This is a guide for newcomers to the server, you can use the table of contents above to jump a specific content if you wish.

This guide assumes you know the basics of Minecraft gameplay and how to join the server.

## First Join

When you first join you will start with some items(tools, sword, food, armor…) you will also receive a couple of keys.
You can access the survival world by using the portal on your right or by typing `/survival` or `/survival2` for 1.18 generated world.
To go back to the spawn world you can use `/spawn` command.

You also have a bed in your inventory, if you wish to pass the night try sleeping! This only works when the majority of the players on the server sleep at the same time.

We use a GUI main menu on our server to access it simply press ‘F’ or type `/menu` . You can access almost everything from this menu, so when you join give this a look.

To use the Keys you got you to need to go to the warp crates. You can do this via the F menu or by typing `/warp crates`(`/crates`) . Just right-click with the key in your hand to the right crate. If left-click a crate you can preview the items in it and your chances.

## Making Your Home

When you are in the survival world you can use `/rtp` command to randomly spawn around the world. There is also a [live server map](https://map.unicornia.net) where you can check a lot of things.

Once you find a place to settle, you will have to claim it to secure it! The first chest you place in the server makes a 9×9 claim by default, you can also expand it. To claim land you have to select two corners of your claim with a golden shovel. You can see our [How to Claim Land guide](/minecraft/how-to-claim-land) if you wish. Everything in your claim is protected and PVP is disabled even infringe cases of grief we do full recovery so do not worry. This said you do not have unlimited claim blocks, you start with 280 blocks and you gain blocks hourly up to 14000. You can also buy claim blocks or earn from crates.

For building the actual home you can get blocks from `/shop`, you can also get decoration blocks from `/headdb`.

### Homes

When you first click a bed it will create your first home, you can go to this home by typing `/home` .
To set a home you can use `/sethome [name]` the name is optional. To access this home later you just need to type `/home [name]` and you will teleport there!
To see all of your homes type `/homes`.
You can create up to 10 homes. VIP players can create up to 30.

## Death

When you die in the server, your items automatically get put in a chest on your death location. When you respawn you should see a GUI with some options if you don’t see this GUI try typing `/acgui` . You can either TP to your death location and claim your chest or fetch the chest to your current location. These both cost different amounts of money.
Your chest stays up for 15 minutes after then it will get deleted. You will also get 70% of your XP back.

Totems of Undying do work from your inventory meaning you do not have to put them on your off-hand.
