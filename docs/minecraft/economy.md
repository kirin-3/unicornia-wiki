## Basics

The server has a basic money economy system. To see your balance use the `/bal` command. You earn money by staying online, killing mobs, achievements, jobs[(click to see Jobs guide)](jobs-guide.md), daily/weekly/monthly rewards, playtime rewards, and also from crates. To learn more about rewards see [Rewards](rewards.md), for mob drops see [Drop Tables](droptables.md).

You are also able to see sell almost every vanilla item to the `/shop`. For unsellable items or valuables, there is also a player auction system you can access with `/ah` command.

## Using Money

Money is mainly used to purchase things from the shop. However, you can also use it to recharge your flight which allows you to fly in the server, for more information on that see [Flight Systems](flight-systems.md).

There are also commands that cost money, such as the `/back` command(costs 1k$), and when you die to teleport to your death location you need to spend money.

PlayerVaults which you can access through the main menu also cost money to use and create.

Buying pets costs money.

## Taxation

Taxes are collected weekly and they are divided into brackets:

* If you have less than `5,000$` you do not pay tax.
* Between `5,000$`-`10,000$` you pay 50$ weekly.
* Between `10,001$`-`50,000$` you pay 100$ weekly.
* Between `50,001$`-`100,000$` you pay 500$ weekly.
* Between `100,001$`-`500,000$` you pay 1,000$ weekly.
* Between `500,001$`-`1,000,000$` you pay 1,500$ weekly.
* Between `1,000,001$`-`5,000,000$` you pay 1,500$ + 0.01$ for every claimed block weekly.
* Between `5,000,001$`-`10,000,000$` you pay 4,000$ + 0.05$ for every claimed block weekly.
* If you have more than `10,000,000$` you pay 8,000$ + 0.1$ for every claimed block weekly.

Yes, this does make you less intensived to claim your blocks, and yes if your base gets griefed it will be restored, however, we are **not** responsible for stolen items.
