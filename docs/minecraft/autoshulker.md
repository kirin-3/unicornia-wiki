## What is Auto Shulkers?

AutoShulkers adds an awesome new feature: shulker boxes can automatically pick up certain drops! Just grab a shulker box and cram into a crafting table, together with a book and all the blocks the shulker box should collect. Whenever you have your shulker box in your inventory, all defined drops that you pick up will automatically be stored inside the shulker box! 

It is also possible to add new block types to an existing AutoShulker, but you have to use a new book for the crafting recipe. If you want the box to behave like a normal shulker box again, just remove the book from inside the shulker box.

## Types and Recipes

**Auto Shulkers:** with these, you can collect certain items(of your choosing) into a shulkerbox in your inventory while mining!
To craft Auto Shulker: `ShulkerBox + Book + one of each item it should collect`

**Garbage Boxes:** these are the same but instead of collecting the items they destroy them automatically for you!
To craft Garbage Box: `ShulkerBox + Lava Bucket + one of each item it should destroy`

If you want the box to behave like a normal shulker box again, just remove the book from inside the shulker box.
