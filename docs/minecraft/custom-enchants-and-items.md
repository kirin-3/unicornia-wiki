## Heads

On our server, you can get custom heads, that serve as decorations. They are small head-sized and shaped blocks. You can get them from the main menu or by typing `/heads` or `/hdb`. They do cost money.

## Custom Items

We have many types of custom items on the server ranging from equipment to chairs and desks. Currently, the only way to acquire these items is to craft them.

To browse custom items click on the book icon on the main menu or type `/ia` this will open up its own GUI. Choose a category or search for the item you want, then click on it, this will show you its recipe. If you click on an item in the recipe it will open that item’s recipe. Some items can be dropped from vanilla mechanics if this is the case you will see an icon below the recipe, hovering over this will show you where does it drop and your chances.

## Custom Enchantments

To see a list of all the enchantments on the server type `/enchants`.
To buy enchantment books use `/enchanter`.

You can use Alchemist to combine two dusts for a better rate or to combine two enchantment books for increased enchantment level *(i.e. two Speed I books for Speed II)*. The command for this is `/alchemist`.

You can use the tinkerer to exchange your enchanted armor for experience or exchange your custom enchant book for a fireball. A fireball has a chance of getting magic dust, which improves the success rate on a given rarity enchant book. The command for this is `/tinkerer`.
