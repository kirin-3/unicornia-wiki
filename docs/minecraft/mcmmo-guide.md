## What is mcMMO?
McMMO’s main function is to incorporate an RPG-like skill system that players have access to right from the beginning. Depending on how much a certain tool is used or a certain action is performed, players will gain experience that will eventually add bonuses such as double drops, rare drops, or ability enhancement.

McMMO can drastically enhance everyday activities, such as mining, farming, or digging, where the special abilities can speed up the process and in some cases, give better item drops. McMMO is also widely used by players who like to partake in PvP, whether it be in the PvP world, or a private arena, McMMO is an opponent of its own and can affect the outcome of a fight in a skilled users hands. McMMO also has a competitive side to it, players race one another to see who can achieve a higher power level or skill level first.

**YOU CAN SEE THE LIST OF SKILLS AND YOUR PROGRESSION WITH THE `/mcmmo` COMMAND ON THE SERVER!**

For more up-to-date and in-depth information feel free to check out [the official mcMMO wiki](https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Main_Page) or this [fan-made wiki](https://mcmmo.fandom.com/wiki/McMMO_Wiki).

## Power Level

A player’s power level can be determined by adding their total levels of all their skills (use `/mcstats` and `/mcsb` keep to test it out yourself). The power level itself has no true effect, aside from being a goal to strive for.

## Skills

Skills are Broken into 3 Categories, Gathering, Combat, and Miscellaneous.

## Gathering
### Excavation

Excavation in McMMO provides a passive ability to dig more blocks and find treasures buried beneath the earth. What you find is based on your skill level and the type of material you are excavating.
​
The drops that are found from breaking blocks range from glow stone dust to discs and can turn a routine digging into a great profitable excavation.

XP Gain:
Experience is gained by using a shovel to break dirt, grass, sand, and clay.

**Active Abilities:**

==Giga Drill Breaker==

Right-clicking with a Shovel in hand will activate Giga Drill Breaker. For a short period of time, it will allow you to instantly break any block that is most effective when broken with a shovel. The duration depends on the level.

**Passive Abilities:**

==Treasure Hunter==

Each time you dig a block, there is a chance to obtain items you would not normally get from digging. These drops can make some extra money, or be used to craft some useful items.

### Fishing

Fishing is a skill that enhances fishing in Minecraft. Fishing skills are all passive.
“It’s more than a challenge to make Fishing rewarding and interesting enough to spend time on, so what we’ve done is gone the traditional RPG route. When you fish you will have a chance to find treasure. Among this treasure, you can find magic items. You will find better items as your skill progresses and the chance of finding magic items will also increase.” – mcMMO Team.

At skill level 150+ you will be able to hook items off of mobs, allowing an easier way to farm certain mob items. For example, if you desperately need eggs you can simply use the fishing rod to obtain the item by casting your line into a chicken.

XP Gain:
Experienced is gained by catching fish or treasures with a fishing rod, or by shaking items off of monsters and animals.

**Passive Abilities:**

==Master Angler==

This passive ability improves the chance of catching a fish, this means that it will take less time before you get a bite! The ability activates when you’re fishing in a boat or while you’re fishing in an ocean biome.
Unlocks at level 125

==Ice Fishing==

This ability allows you to fish in icy biomes. Cast your fishing rod on an ice block and a water hole will appear.
Unlocks at level 50

==Treasure Hunter==

Player has a chance to find random items in addition to the fishes they reel in. Chance and quality of items increase as Fishing skill is leveled up!

There is a 6.12% to 25% chance for the item pulled to be randomly enchanted. The strength/level of enchantment and odds of the said item being enchanted depends on the Fishing level and Treasure Hunter Tier.

==Magic Hunter==

Magic hunter is the probability of fishing an enchanted treasure with the probability of an enchanted item appearing, starting at 6.67% (rank 1/5) at level 1-199, and increasing by 6.67% per 200 Fishing levels. At level 800, the probability caps at a maximum of 33.3% (rank 5/5).

Sometimes the message “You feel a touch of magic in this cast.” will appear to indicate the skill activating.

==Shake==

From fishing level 150 onwards, the player will be able to shake items loose from mobs by hooking them with the fishing pole.

Shake can be used repeatedly for a large number of items depending on the remaining health of the mob (Fishing Rod deals 1 damage to mobs). For instance, a Skeleton at full health can drop up to 37 arrows before they die.

==Farmer’s Diet==

Your past experience with growth hormones has taught you how to get the most out of your food. This passive skill increases the amount of hunger herbalism foods restores as your Herbalism level increases.

==Hylian Luck==

* Grass
* Saplings

Flower pots break Emeralds, Diamonds, or Gold Nuggets.

==Blast Mining==

Instead of using a pickaxe to break blocks, Blast Mining is done with TNT and Flint & Steel. This ability is activated by crouching and lighting TNT with a Flint & Steel. At higher levels, the player will receive Triple drops and no debris. As the number of drops gained from the explosion increases with your Mining level, so does the radius of the explosion. Damage taken by TNT lit with this ability is decreased, but not negated.

Note that normally TNT drops 30% debris. Also, the blast radius of TNT increases at levels 250, 500, 750, and 1000.

**Passive Abilities:**

80xp is awarded for each heart of damage taken when a Roll or Graceful Roll has been executed, including the damage that would have been taken without the roll. Because of this, 2960xp is the maximum experience that can be gained without Feather Falling boots, with a Graceful Roll, at the height of 37 blocks.

Feather falling boots multiply the experience gained from acrobatics by two, regardless of the level of boots.

A successful dodge is awarded 120xp

### Alchemy

Alchemy is about brewing potions. It provides a speed increase in the potion brew time, as well as the addition of new (previously) unobtainable potions.

XP Gain:
XP is gained by brewing potions. The amount of XP you receive depends on what stage of potion you are brewing.

There are four stages of potions; base potion, regular potion, a potion with one amplifier, and a potion with two amplifiers. There is also a special potion stage for when you switch amplifiers, e.g. you add Redstone dust to a level II potion.

**Passive Abilities:**

==Catalysis==

Catalysis speeds of the brewing process, with a max speed of 4x at level 1000. This ability is unlocked at level 100 by default.

==Concoctions==

Concoctions allow the brewing of more potions with custom ingredients. Which special ingredients are unlocked is determined by your Rank. There are 8 ranks to unlock.

![mcMMO Alchemy](/assets/images/mcmmo-alchemy.png){ loading=lazy }

Important things to note about these custom recipes:

* The custom potions created only by unlockable recipes will always be colored red like an instant health potion, regardless of the effects.
* The custom potions created only by unlockable recipes cannot be empowered using glowstone or Redstone dust.
* Attempting to brew gunpowder or Dragon’s Breath into the custom potions created only by unlockable recipes will result in an Uncraftable Splash or Lingering potion, respectively. This potion has no effect. However, using gunpowder or Dragon’s Breath on an awkward potion and then adding the custom ingredient last will result in a Splash or Lingering potion of the proper effect, respectively.
* Ingredients that have been named in an anvil can NOT be used in Alchemy’s custom recipes, and will not receive the Catalysis brewing speed boost. (i.e. a Slimeball named “Fred” can NOT make a dull potion, and a Fermented Spider Eye named “RIP George” will brew at regular speed regardless of the brewer’s Alchemy skill.)

### Smelting

Smelting is a child skill of Mining and Repair. The effective Smelting level is the average of the parent skill levels. Smelting was the first child skill added to McMMO.

**Passive Abilities:**

==Fuel Efficiency==

Fuel Efficiency is a passive ability of Smelting that makes the burn time of fuel in a furnace extend. Each level increases the efficiency multiplier by about 0.04. For example, Fuel Efficiency reaches 4x at level 1000.

==Second Smelt==

This ability will grant a second piece of whatever you’re smelting, whether it logs to charcoal, iron ore to iron, and even gold ore to gold. The chance of the player doing a second smelt increases 0.1% per Smelting level. At level 1000, you have a 100% chance of getting a second smelt.

==Vanilla XP Boost==

The Vanilla XP Boost ability is passive, like all Smelting abilities are, that grants more experience from a furnace when you smelt materials or ores such as iron ore, oak logs, and sand. The more levels you increase in the smelting skill, the more experience you will gain when you smelt something in a furnace. Like all abilities, Vanilla XP Boost caps at 1000 levels.

## Parties

Party levels may be set to unlock at specific party levels. Parties let you create a group of people you can talk to without public chat listening to your conversation. Only if you are a party leader can you pick the games that your party plays.
