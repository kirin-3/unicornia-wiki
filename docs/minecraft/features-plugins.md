## Menus
We have made a sizeable effort to prevent people from memorizing commands by adding GUI-based menus. These all can be accessed from the main menu which you can access by pressing F or by typing `/menu`.

## Economy

We have an ever-evolving economy with server shops, jobs, and player shops. There are many things to buy including VIP and VIP perks, spawners, custom enchantments books, and more.

EXP is generally has a greater value in the server due to custom enchantments costing XP.

Jobs give you the unique ability to earn points which you can redeem for keys and keys can be exchanged for better keys or for money and XP.

Earning money is relatively easy, any farm can be profitable as mobs drop money and you can sell almost anything in the server shop.

## SlimeFun4

SlimeFun4 adds many aspects of popular mods to the vanilla version such as generators, machines, magic altars, and many many more. Check out more information about it in [slimefun guide].
