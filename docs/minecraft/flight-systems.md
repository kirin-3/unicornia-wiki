## Elytras

When using an elytra you will see a speedometer on the bottom of your screen.

You can boost your elytra speed with right-click. This can also be used for launch. **You have to have a Feather in your hand** Cost: 2XP each time

VIP players can now use the super boost which is 3x more powerful than the normal one. To use it hold a feather and shift right-click. Cost: 6 XP each time

## Flight Charge System

Flight charge system allows players to fly(like in creative mode) but costs money or XP for each block traveled.

To recharge your flight, you can use `/fcharge` or `/recharge` alternatively, you can access this from the main menu.

You can buy up to 10,000 charges at once. ( 10,000  blocks traveled.)

If you run out of charges mid-flight you will be teleported back to the ground to avoid “accidents”.

There is also an auto-recharge option which you can toggle with `/autorecharge <exp/money/off>` .
This only recharges when you reach 5% of your maximum allowed charges and fills up 10% charge.
