title: HOW CAN I MUTE A CHANNEL?
---

You can mute a channel by right-clicking and going to the mute channel option. You select either a specific time or indefinitely but you can unmute channels later. If you mute a channel you will not receive any kind of notification from that channel but if someone mentions you, you will see a red circle next to it.
