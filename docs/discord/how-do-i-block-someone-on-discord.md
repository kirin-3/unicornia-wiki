title: HOW DO I BLOCK SOMEONE ON DISCORD?
---

Blocking on Discord is easy. Just right-click on the offending user’s name and click Block! Any attempt to DM you will be met with an automated message saying the message was not delivered. If you would like to unblock someone later on, you can do so from your Friends tab. On the top row of categories, there is a Blocked category. You’ll see a list of your blocked users and can simply unblock them.
