title: ARE BOTS IN DISCORD SAFE?
---

Theoretically, a bot could steal a lot of data that goes through him, but that really depends on the developer of the bot and its permissions. Although using the most popular bots itâ€™s extremely safe. Only a very small percentage of bots are actually made maliciously, but always keep an eye out just to be safe.

In our server (Unicornia) we only use bots that are hosted by ourselves or very popular and proven bots, so you have nothing to worry about in our server.
