title: HOW DO I CHANGE MY ID NUMBER IN DISCORD?
---

Your 4-digit ID code that comes after your Discord username is only changeable if you have paid for Discord Nitro. Nitro allows you to customize this number. If you do not have Nitro, you are stuck with your randomly-assigned number. If you have nitro you can change it in Settings>My Account and click on the edit button next to your nickname.
