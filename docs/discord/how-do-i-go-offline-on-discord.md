title: HOW DO I GO OFFLINE ON DISCORD?
---

If you would like to appear offline on Discord, start by clicking on your profile image, which youâ€™ll find near the bottom left corner of the app. By default, there will be a green dot on your photo. This indicates that you are online and visible. If you want to appear idle, you can click the yellow crescent that says Idle next to it. This indicates that you have Discord open but may not respond immediately. The red dot, Do Not Disturb, indicates to other users that you may be online, but that you will not be receiving notifications if they send you a message. The last option, a grey ring, is Invisible. If you are offline, this is how you will appear to others. But if you manually select this option you can use Discord as normal, but be super stealthy while you do it!
