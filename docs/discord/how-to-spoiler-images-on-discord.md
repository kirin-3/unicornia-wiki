---

## On Unicornia

On our server, you can spoiler images with `&spoiler` command. Just type `&spoiler` with your image attached and it will be auto spoilered, it will deleted after 10 seconds.

## On Desktop/Browser

Just click the “Mark as spoiler” option while sharing a picture and you are good to go.

## Mobile

On mobile, it is a bit trickier. What you need to do is rename the photo name so for example if the image name is `example.jpg` you need to make it `SPOILER_example.jpg`. Just add the `SPOILER_` in front of whatever the file name is and share that photo, it will be automatically spoilered.

### Android

Go to your file manager. Rename the picture to `SPOILER_imagename`. Now it is renamed you can share it on discord.

### iPhone/IOS

Add your images to your files app. Rename your picture to `SPOILER_imagename` (SPOILER has to be all capital letters). Then attach the file to discord through your Files app, not your gallery or other apps.
