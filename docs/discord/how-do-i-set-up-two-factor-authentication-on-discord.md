title: HOW DO I SET UP TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ON DISCORD?
---

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account, by requiring verification from another device, like a phone. To enable this feature, click on the settings cog in Discord, then “Enable Two Factor Authentication”. You will be prompted to add your special authentication key to an authentication app.
