title: IS MY IP ADDRESS SAFE WHILE USING DISCORD?
---

Yes, your IP address is safe while using Discord. No other Discord users can tell your IP just from your Discord account. However, when you click an external link that takes you outside of Discord, you run the risk of your IP being grabbed by that external site.
