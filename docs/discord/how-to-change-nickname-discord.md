title: HOW DO I CHANGE MY DISCORD NICKNAME ON THE SERVER?
---

All you have to do to change your nickname per server is to click on that server’s settings and click on “Change Nickname”. You can do this for each individual server, so you can have a name in each one!

Alternatively, you can type `/nick your-desired-nick` in a text channel to change it. Typing just `/nick` will reset your nickname in that server.
